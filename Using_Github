#### How to add existing project to GitHub using command line####

First create a new repository on your GitHub account. I created a new 
one called 'machine_learning'. The corresponding url:https://github.com/priyaroy/machine_learning.git

Then, follow instructions on https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

For me, I did the following:

0) Using terminal, I went to the local directory 'machine_learning' on my laptop. 
1) Update .gitignore file to ignore big files. E.g., to ignore a folder 'datasets', add 'datasets/' to .gitignore ASCII file. Then enter the following commands

    1a) $git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
    1b) $git rm -r --cached . #If the repositry already exists
 
2) $git status
3) $git add .
   # Stage the files for commit

3) $git commit -m "first commit"
   # This prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.

4a) git remote add origin https://github.com/priyaroy/machine_learning.git
   #If origin path is not added. Else, skip to step 5)

4b) git remote -V
   #Verifies the new remote url

5) git push origin master
   # pushes changes in your local repository on your laptop to the specified url
   # which correspnds to the remote repo. 
   # You will be prompted to enter your github username and password. 
   # username: priyaroy
   #password: <is a secret>
